<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>I encountered some confusion in the console this time around. It was weird 
    because the function code was correct and I was getting the correct output in 
    the console, but when I would interact with the console on the browser itself (such 
    as type in 'basket') it would not respond with the items I entered in the code.
    Instead it would output the input items that were included in the test js file.
    So I don't know how to ask the question, but pretty much it'd be great and helpful
    to better understand behind the scenes of how the console interacts with the html file. 
    Also, is there a particular reason why people change/make edits via the browser console 
    rather than just the js file in VS code? Is this only possible for simple things like 
    adding, removing, shifting items to a list (like in week 3 Arrays Practical video)? </li>
